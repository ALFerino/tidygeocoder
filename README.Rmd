## Introduction

Tidygeocoder makes getting data from geocoder services easy. In addition to the usage example below you can find a post on making a map of European soccer club stadiums [here](https://jessecambon.github.io/2020/07/15/tidygeocoder-1-0-0.html), a post on mapping landmarks in Washington, DC [here](https://jessecambon.github.io/2019/11/11/tidygeocoder-demo.html), and a vignette with more detailed usage examples [here](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/articles/tidygeocoder.html).

All results are returned in [tibble format](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/). Batch geocoding (geocoding multiple addresses per query) is used by default for the US Census and Geocodio services when multiple addresses are provided. Duplicate, missing/NA, and blank address data is handled elegantly - only unique addresses are passed to geocoder services, but the rows in the original data are preserved.

## Geocoder Services

The currently supported services are the [US Census geocoder](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/), [Nominatim (OSM)](https://nominatim.org), [Geocodio](https://www.geocod.io/), and [Location IQ](https://locationiq.com/). The Census geocoder is restricted to street-level addresses in the United States, Geocodio covers the U.S. and Canada, while Location IQ and OSM have worldwide coverage. The Census and OSM services support batch geocoding (Location IQ and OSM do not). 

The Census and OSM services are free; Geocodio and Location IQ are commercial services that require API keys, but also offer free usage tiers. OSM and Location IQ both have usage frequency limits. Refer to the documentation of each service for more details.

## Installation

To install the stable version from CRAN (the official R package servers):

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages('tidygeocoder')
```

Alternatively you can install the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=F}
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jessecambon/tidygeocoder")
```

## Usage

In this example we will geocode a few addresses using the `geocode()` function and plot them on a map with ggplot. 


```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(tidygeocoder)

# create a dataframe with addresses
some_addresses <- tribble(
~name,                  ~addr,
"White House",          "1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC",
"Transamerica Pyramid", "600 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94111",     
"Willis Tower",         "233 S Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60606"                                  
)

# geocode the addresses
lat_longs <- some_addresses %>%
  geocode(addr, method = 'census', lat = latitude , long = longitude)
```

The `geocode()` function attaches latitude and longitude columns to our input dataset of addresses. The US Census geocoder is used here, but other services can be specified with the `method` argument. See the `geo()` function documentation for details.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(lat_longs)
```

Now that we have the longitude and latitude coordinates, we can use ggplot to plot our addresses on a map.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(lat_longs, aes(longitude, latitude), color="grey99") +
  borders("state") + geom_point() + 
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = name)) + 
  theme_void()
```

To return the full results from a geocoder service (not just latitude and longitude) you can use `full_results = TRUE`. Additionally, for the Census geocoder you can use `return_type = 'geographies'` to return geography columns (state, county, Census tract, and Census block).

```{r}
full <- some_addresses %>%
  geocode(addr, method = 'census', full_results = TRUE, return_type = 'geographies')

glimpse(full)
```
